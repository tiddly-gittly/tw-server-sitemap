! Changelog

!! 0.1.0 - 2025-11-23

!!! Breaking Changes

* Changed from `no-cors` mode to normal fetch mode with fallback, which allows proper HTTP status code detection

!!! New Features

* ''Full URL path checking'': Now checks the complete URL including path, not just the domain. A 404 error will correctly show as offline
* ''HTTP status code detection'': Properly detects and reports HTTP status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
* ''Redirect handling'': Added `follow-redirects` parameter (default: `yes`) to control whether HTTP redirects (301, 302, etc.) should be followed
* ''Background monitoring'': Added `background-mode` parameter to run checks without displaying the badge
* ''Action triggers'': Added `connect-actions` and `disconnect-actions` parameters to invoke actions when website status changes
* ''Better error reporting'': Status now shows specific HTTP error codes when available (e.g., "Error (404)", "Redirect (301)")
* ''CORS fallback'': Automatically falls back to no-cors mode when CORS errors occur, with indication in status text

!!! Improvements

* Improved status change detection to avoid triggering actions on initial check
* Better handling of edge cases like SSL certificate errors and network failures
* Enhanced documentation with more examples

!!! Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where HTTP redirects were incorrectly shown as offline
* Fixed issue where 404 errors on valid domains were shown as online
* Fixed issue where plain HTTP sites were incorrectly reported as offline
